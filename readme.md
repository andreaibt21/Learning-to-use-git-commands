In this web page I was able to use HTML and CSS.

My bootcamp gave me a task with a simulated client that wanted a web page for his football club.
The client wanted to have the schedule games with locations, a registration form and rules for players, also an 'about us' page to show their vision, mission and general information and finally a contact page.

You can check out the final result here:
